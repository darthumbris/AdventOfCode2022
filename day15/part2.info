Since the point must be one unit outside of 4 diamonds, 
if you expand each diamond by one unit: when taking each side of each diamond as clockwise vectors,
 there should only be one point that is the intersection of four vectors 
 where the the 1st/2nd and 3rd/4th are colinear and opposite, and 1st and 3rd are perpendicular.
